# Contributing to Open Source

This is a great sign for employers as it is proof of your skills. It is the best way to learn how to work in software engineering teams.

[ZTM projects](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery) are a great way to practice open source contributions. Make sure you add yourself to the _contributors.md_.

Be sure to make sure the organizations you contribute to can be seen on your github profile.
