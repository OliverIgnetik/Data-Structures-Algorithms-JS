### Secret Weapon

- Finish with the following points in mind
  - Don't overuse "I"
  - Talk about the interviewer
  - Express how you are the ideal candidate
  - Don't brag

#### EXAMPLE

I'm sure you have lots of candidates to see but I want to say one last thing.

There are no shortages of developers for you to interview. However, there is a shortage of good talented egoless developers with ambition to learn.

It's not the ones that are unable to admit that they are wrong. The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders. It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong.

I am not the most experienced developer that you may interview today but the one thing that you can guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his or her skill every day, play nicely with all the other developers that the company isn't so narrow minded and problem solving
that he or she isn't willing to try new and novel ideas.

When you hire me you will rest assured that you won't have to micromanage me, you won't have to extinguish fires and in one year I'll be one of your most valuable employees.

I can guarantee you that I'm at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can grow with and be surrounded by smart people like yourself.

And I've chosen this company specifically for that reason.
You've probably had similar experiences in your career where one company allows you to really have an impact and propel your career.

I'm at this stage now and I hope to be part of the team with you. So thank you for your time and I hope to hear back soon from you.

## Offer and Negotiation

### Handling rejection

- Nobody really cares because it doesn't go on your resume.
- Extract as much information as possible. There is no harm they already rejected you
- Is it ok to reapply?

### Negotiation

_Nothing makes a company more upset then losing a candidate with a lot of potential to competitors_

1. Don't end the conversation
2. Give reason for everything
3. Always negotiate
4. Be positive
5. Have stakes (ie. other options lined up).

- You will never have your offer revoked for negotiating
- Be positive you are just exploring options
- Be aware of the average software developer salary
  - thats a great starting point
  - you're not actually demanding anything
- Thank them for the offer and try to extend the decision time by focusing on the fact that it's a big decision and you would like to work at a company for many years so you would like to think about it

### Handling an offer

**The ball is in your court**

_TODO_

- Find exact salary you want
  - [Stackoverflow salary tool](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/salary?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=salary-calculator-2018)
- What value do you provide?
- Go higher

_TIPS_

1. Don't end the conversation
2. Be positive
3. Ask for time
4. Let other companies know (especially if you have been given an offer). It gives the company more confidence to invest in you via social proof.
5. Know the deadlines
6. Don't burn any bridges when you decline an offer

### Handling multiple offers

**GUIDING PRINCIPLES**

1. Which company do you want to work at?
2. Is there an offer that you feel you are under qualified for
3. Long term growth potential
4. Salary and benefits?
5. Is your decision based on desperation? Is this company worth it?

**USEFUL TIPS**

- Let the other companies know if you have been offered another job so you can have some stakes in negotiation
- Take the job that will push you

### Getting a raise

_If you never ask the answer is always no!_

[Example of how to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5SeCl_8NE&feature=youtu.be)

- You need a self-determined work ethic
- Plan out your career trajectory

1. Ask for a raise. It's not considered rude, don't be afraid of it. Finding a new employee as good as you can be expensive
2. _Show them your value_ with proof of measurable outcomes
3. Start a lot higher then what you want

#### TIPS

- Keep a portfolio
  - projects you have done
  - money you have saved
  - problems solved
  - what have you learned

## Junior to Senior Developers

1. Learn to learn
   - study learning techniques
   - what makes you a successful learner?
2. Start with why (Big picture decisions)
   - why are we learning this topic?
   - Fundamental computer science topics
   - You don't want to be playing catch up all the time
