# Graphs

![graph example](.\graph.png)

Graphs are one of the most useful data structures when it comes to modelling real life situations.

Data structures that are graphs :

- trees (directed acyclic graph)
- linked lists (directed acyclic graph)

## Features

- node/ vertex
- edges connect the nodes
- directed or undirected (direction of possible traversals)
- weighted or unweighted (information in the edges)
- cyclic or acyclic

## Applications

- recommendation engines
- google maps
- network structures

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- relationships (some data needs to be represented as graphs)
- can make use of powerful algorithms

### Cons

- Scaling is hard
